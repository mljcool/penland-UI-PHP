            Penland makes a substantial investment when planning a workshop, and
            vacancies can be hard to fill even if there is a waiting list, so we
            must charge cancellation fees to offset the cost of these vacancies.
            All cancellations must be made in writing, via email, to
            <a href="mailto:registrar@penland.org" target="_blank"
              >registrar@penland.org</a
            >
            If you cancel anytime up to 30 before the beginning of a workshop, you
            will receive a refund minus the $50 nonrefundable processing fee and a
            cancellation fee
            <b>($250 for concentration and $100 for all other workshops).</b>
            If you cancel less than 30 days before the beginning of the workshop,
            refunds are not available. However, if you test positive for COVID-19
            within the 10 days prior to your workshop, please contact the
            registrar. If it is necessary for Penland to cancel a workshop for any
            reason, students will be notified and offered another class or a full
            refund. We cannot, however, be responsible for nonrefundable airline
            tickets or other travel expenses. <br />This policy also applies to
            partial scholarship recipients.
